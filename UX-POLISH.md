# JAMMIX Site - UX Polish TODO

## Issues Identified (2025-12-22)

1. **Hero image (PCB) too big** - Fixed panel image needs to be scaled down slightly

2. **Hero text runs into logo** - Left pane text crowding, needs spacing adjustment

3. **Gallery orientation wrong** - Currently horizontal (4-column grid), should be vertical/stacked layout like original site on desktop
